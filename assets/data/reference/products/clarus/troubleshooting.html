                <td>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> The application doesn't wait for the MySQL service to boot, but instead triggers an emergency shutdown.</p>
                    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Wait a few minutes after an OS boot-up before starting the Clarus application. Clarus application v1.1.4 typically starts successfully on the second or third attempt.</p></td>

                    <p>There are two ways to trigger a backup. Either will work for this workaround.</p>

                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Do not select another image immediately after marking ONH location.</p>
                    <p>Wait a moment for the ONH location save process to complete before selecting another image.</p>
                    <p>If already saved incorrectly, manually re-locate the ONH on the image and wait a moment for the process to complete.</p>
