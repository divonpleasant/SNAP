    <h1>Slit Lamp Reference Index</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Slit Lamps are ophthalmic biomicroscopes used for viewing structures of the eye. Nearly every eye doctor (OD and MD) will have and use the slit lamp on nearly every patient. The "slit" beam width, height, and shape can be adjusted by the operator to provide optimal viewing of the eye structure they are working on.</p>
    <p>Slit Lamps by themselves are just microscopes without any computer, database, or connectivity. If an optional Slit Lamp Imaging (SL Imaging) module has been installed, the device will now have a PC (Zeiss- or customer-supplied) with imaging software, database, and USB camera connected to the slit lamp for recording still and video images.</p>
    <p>Other accessories, like a Tonometer or co-observation device, can be added if required by the customer.</p>
    <p>Zeiss lasers can also be attached to a non-laser slit lamp using an adapter, but this is uncommon.</p>
