    <h2>Image or Scan Quality Issues</h2>
    <a name="clean-lens"></a>
    <p>The Ocular Lens (also called the Main Lens or Patient Lens) housed in the Imaging Aperture should be cleaned regularly. The lens is easily compromised by contact with eyebrows, noses, fingers, foreheads and can become greasy or embedded with dust. If not cleaned properly according to the instructions provided in the user manual (IFU), it can streak. The lens has a protective coating which can also start to peel, crack, or flake away.</p>
    <p><i style="color: #fdbb08" class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> <strong>Always verify the Ocular Lens is clean!</strong> <i style="color: #fdbb08" class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i><br />
    Customers will often insist the lens is cleaned regularly without verification.</p>
    <a name="verify-clean-lens"></a>
    <h3>Verifing Lens Cleanliness</h3>
    <p>Any image or scan quality complaints should be followed up with questions regarding the cleanliness of the lens. Don't take a customer's word for it, with the application open and on the <a href="#acquire-screen">Acquire Screen</a>, check the <a href="#iris-camera">Iris Camera</a> while the customer shines a flashlight onto the lens. This can often reveal missed spots, peeling lens coating, or embedded dust, all of which can result in poor scan quality, artifacts on scans, or <a href="#low-signal-strength">low signal strength</a> issues.</p>

    <h2>Collecting and Analyzing OCT Log Files</h2>
    <a name="log-location"></a>
    <h3>Logs Location</h3>
    <p>Cirrus HD-OCT log files are stored in <strong>C:\ProgramData\Carl Zeiss Meditec\Cirrus HD-OCT\Logs</strong></p>
    <p>You can also acquire logs by using the Logfile Collector option in the Help > Service Support menu.</p>
    <a name="11-5-x-logs"></a>
    <h4>11.5.X (and earlier)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Current or most recent log file is named 'log.txt'</li>
        <li>Older logs are numbered 1 &ndash; 9 as a suffix on the file extension (e.g. log.txt1, log.txt2...) with 1 being the most recent logs and 9 being the oldest</li>
        <li>Logs older than the oldest entries in log.txt9 are lost to logfile rotation and cannot be recovered</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="11-7-x-logs"></a>
    <h4>11.7.X (and later)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>All log files are named 'Datelog_YYYYMMDD.txt' where YYYY is the four-digit year, MM is the two-digit month, and DD is the two-digit day</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Start-Up Issues</h2>
    <a name="instrument-not-powering-up"></a>
    <h3>Instrument Won't Power Up</h3>
    <a name="basic-power-on-troubleshooting"></a>
    <h4>Basic Power Troubleshooting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Check and reseat instrument and table power cords (see <a href="#check-table-function">Check Table Function</a>), ensuring cords are well seated and are in good condition, i.e. not worn, frayed, or crimped</li>
        <li>Remove power cable from any surge protectors, power strips, battery backups, or the like and plug directly into a wall outlet</li>
        <li>Check or test outlet for power coming from outlet</li>
        <li>Ensure instrument power issues are not related to overheating: check top fan filter is clean and ensure all air vents are not blocked</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="fse-power-troubleshooting"></a>
    <h5>Power Troubleshooting Requiring Onsite Visit (FSE)</h5>
    <p>Field Service Engineers (FSEs) can perform additional power on issue troubleshooting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check table fuses</li>
        <li>Check PC module fuses (applies to CMY2014 computer only)</li>
        <li><a href="#corneal-lens-replacement">Verify power to the optics module/corneal lens</a> (especially if the lens was recently replaced</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="check-table-function"></a>
    <h4>Check Table Function</h4>
    <p>Most of our devices get power through the power table they sit on. The power table only draws current when being adjusted (up or down), otherwise all power flows to the outlet.</p>
    <p><strong>Does the table go up and/or down?</strong></p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>No</th>
                <th>Yes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

            <tr>
                <td><ul>
                    <li>Check the power cable from the wall outlet to the table</li>
                    <li>Plug power cord directly from the instrument to the wall outlet and test; if instrument powers up, power table may require service</li>
                </ul></td>
                <td><ul>
                    <li>Check the power cable from the table to the instrument</li>
                    <li>Plug power cord directly from the instrument to the wall outlet and test; if instrument powers up, the table's power cable may be defective or the outlet on the power table may require service</li>
                </ul></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <a name="corneal-lens-replacement"></a>
    <h4>Verify Recent Corneal Lens Replacement</h4>
    <p>If the corneal lens (patient module lens) was recently replaced, the unit may not power on if the optics module connection board (triangle board) is not supplying power to the lens. Verify if a recent onsite repair was performed and whether the lens was replaced/modified/adjusted. It may require a follow-up onsite to ensure the lens power is properly seated.</p>
    <a name="6000-power-on-blank-screen"></a>
    <h4>Cirrus 6000 Won't Power Up or Blank/Black Screen After Power On</h4>
    <p>First generation configurations of the Cirrus 6000's external monitor have a hidden/invisible/touch power button on the underside of the bezel on the lower right hand side. It is common for this button to be pressed by accident.</p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blank/black/dark screen</li>
        <li>Power on, but no display</li>
        <li>Appears to not turn on</li>
        <li>Unit sounds like it's turning on, but nothing appears on-screen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Customers report this issue in a number of ways, depending on how much troubleshooting they do themselves. Some will note the power does appear to turn on, and describe the issue as a display problem. Others will overlook that the instrument powers up and describe it as more of a power issue.</p>
    <p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>
    <p>The indentations on the underside of the bezel on the right of the screen are touch-control buttons. It's easy to accidentally trigger these buttons when adjusting or moving the monitor, causing the display power to switch off and appear as if the device is not functioning.</p>

        <span class="caption">Cirrus HD-OCT Model 6000 Display power indicator LED (circled in green)</span>
    </div>
    <p>To confirm, have the customer look for the illuminated green LED in the lower right corner of the display, just above the white bezel. If there is no green LED visible, the monitor's power is off.</p>
    <div class="section-break"></div>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <div class="img-r">
        <img src="images/reference/oct/cirrus_hd-oct_6000_hidden_buttons.jpg" style="width: 500px" />
        <span class="caption">Cirrus HD-OCT Model 6000 Bezel underside, showing touch control buttons including the power button (circled in green)</span>
    </div>
    <p>Have the customer reach under the bezel and tap the indentation furthest to the right. This is the "invisible" power switch. It should illuminate the LED and power on the display, restoring proper usage.</p>

    <h2>Application Start-Up Issues</h2>
    <p>The Cirrus HD-OCT application should launch automatically on boot, though some customers may have configured their Windows settings to boot to the desktop instead. In most cases, the Windows Desktop appears briefly after start-up before the OCT application launches. <em>Technicians should be trained not to manually launch the OCT application via the taskbar or desktop icon when the application is configured to launch automatically</em>. Doing so can cause issues with the application and database processes.</p>

    <h3>Start-Up Check Does Not Pass</h3>
    <div class="img-r">
        <img src="images/reference/oct/cirrus_hd-oct_start-up_check_error.png" />
        <span class="caption">OCT Start-Up Check screen displaying an Instrument error with standard error message</span>
    </div>
    <p>The Cirrus HD-OCT application performs a set of evaluations each time it is launched, confirming access to the local database, available disk space on the PC module's system and data disk partitions, available archive volume storage space (if the software is configured to run in archive mode), presence of key files, and the health of the instrument's scanning and operation hardware components.</p>
    <p>If any of these checks fails, the software will display an error and may prevent the instrument from acquiring scans, analyzing previous patient data, or in some cases completing the application's launch.</p>
