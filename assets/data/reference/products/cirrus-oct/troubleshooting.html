    <h2>Image or Scan Quality Issues</h2>
    <a name="clean-lens"></a>
    <p>The Ocular Lens (also called the Main Lens or Patient Lens) housed in the Imaging Aperture should be cleaned regularly. The lens is easily compromised by contact with eyebrows, noses, fingers, foreheads and can become greasy or embedded with dust. If not cleaned properly according to the instructions provided in the user manual (IFU), it can streak. The lens has a protective coating which can also start to peel, crack, or flake away.</p>
    <p><i style="color: #fdbb08" class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Always verify the Ocular Lens is clean! <i style="color: #fdbb08" class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i><br />
    Customers will often insist the lens is cleaned regularly without verification.</p>

    <h3>Verifing Lens Cleanliness</h3>
    <p>Any image or scan quality complaints should be followed up with questions regarding the cleanliness of the lens. Don't take a customer's word for it, with the application open and on the <a href="#acquire-screen">Acquire Screen</a>, check the <a href="#iris-camera">Iris Camera</a> while the customer shines a flashlight onto the lens. This can often reveal missed spots, peeling lens coating, or embedded dust, all of which can result in poor scan quality, artifacts on scans, or <a href="#low-signal-strength">low signal strength</a> issues.</p>
