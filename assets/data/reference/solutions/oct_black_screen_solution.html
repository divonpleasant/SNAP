<p>On the 6000 model, the initial shipping display part (Cirrus 6000 Monitor, part number 266002-1174-591) included a set of "hidden" touch-sensitive buttons. These buttons are positioned along the bottom right of the monitor bezel, and appear to be fingertip-shaped depressions. These buttons can be hard to see and, because there is no tactile feedback, can easily be pressed inadvertently. Particularly if the power button (the one on the far right) is pressed, the monitor will be powered off even if the system is shut on or off. When the instrument is started up with the monitor power off, the PC module will power on but the screen will remain off.</p>
<p>Direct customers to try pressing the power button to turn the display back on. Most of the time, this is the issue and it is easily resolved.</p>

<p>Later 6000 models (manufactured after October, 2024) ship with a different display part (Cirrus 6000 Monitor Low-Cost Version, part number 266002-1185-328) which includes mechanical buttons that are not as easily activated during normal use.</p>
<p>If the customer has the newer monitor, or they have verified the power to the touch-button monitor is on and the screen is still not displaying images, verify the HDMI cables are secure to the monitor and to the PC module. If the power and cables have been verified, dispatch a Field Service Engineer.</p>
