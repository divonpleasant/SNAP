<p>Typically this is an issue with a network drive mapping. The first step is to shut the instrument down to force a restart.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have customer press the power button for one (1) second to attempt a power off</li>
    <li>If the one-second press doesn't stop the device, have customer hold the power button for ten (10) seconds to force the power off</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the device is powered off, have the customer unplug the network/Ethernet cable. With no network connectivity, the IOLMaster will not attempt to reconnect to mapped network drives as part of the Checking Device start-up sequence, which will allow for troubleshooting the connection.</p>
<p>With the Ethernet cable disconnected, have the customer power on the device, and IOLMaster software should boot up properly. Once the application is running, instruct the customer to plug the network/Ethernet cable back in.</p>
<p>In Settings &gt; Network, disconnect the mapped drive causing the issue to clear the problem. Then, reconfigure the mapping paying special attention to the credentials username. It should have the format <code>locale</code>\<code>username</code> where <code>locale</code> is either the hostname or the domain, depending on whether the user is local to the share or a member of the domain.</p>
<p>Once reconfigured, restart the IOLMaster to test and verify the mapping reconnects and the hanging/locking on boot has resolved.</p>
