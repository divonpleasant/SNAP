<p>This error is caused by a known issue in systems running HFA software less than version 1.5.3. Ask or assist the customer in upgrading the system to version 1.5.3 or later.</p><p>If the system is already running version 1.5.3 or later, the issue is likely a hardware failure in the turret motor. A Field Service Engineer onsite dispatch is required to replace the turret motor. Instruct the customer to run the log analyzer and capture any additional errors, then shut down the instrument and leave it powered off until an FSE can come onsite.</p>
