<p>These errors occur when any of the start-up diagnostic tests fail as the software launches. The customer-presented error is generic and could have many underlying root causes. Regardless of root cause, the instrument cannot Acquire scans until or unless this error is resolved.</p>
<p>A hard power cycle should always be attempted first before any deeper investigation. Often the diagnostic failure will be transient and a reboot will allow the device to start up without any further errors. If the issue is intermittent but persisent, it may require an FSE onsite dispatch to confirm the hardware components are not compromised.</p>
