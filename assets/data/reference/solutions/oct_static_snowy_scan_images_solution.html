<p>Most of the time, the root cause of this issue is poor brightness/contrast settings. In general, OCT imaging is delicate, and the settings can be skewed even without direct intervention from the operators (e.g. from power fluctuations).</p>
<p>To resolve:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the OCT Scan section of the screen (right side of the dividing line, toward the bottom near the middle of the screen) there should be a button with an icon resembling either a "magic wand" or a "half-eclipsed sun," depending on scan type and software version. These are the brightness/contrast settings. Click the button <img src="images/solutions/cirrus_hd-oct_magic_wand_icon.png" /></li>
    <li>In the brightness/contrast control panel, toward the bottom there should be another button with an icon displaying a leftward-looping arrow, indicating "revert." This restores the brightness and contrast settings to their factory defaults. Click this button <img src="images/solutions/cirrus_hd-oct_reset_icon.png" /></li>
    <li>Close the Brightness/Contrast control panel</li>
    <li>Verify the OCT scan preview windows are now showing the expected visual data</li>
</ul>
