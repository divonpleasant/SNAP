<p>Most likely the instrument's internal Ethernet connection is not properly set up.</p>
<p>Have the customer check the main PC unit (underneath the camera), specifically the Ethernet connectors. The Cirrus Photo connects to the OCT engine (a separate box often positioned off to the side or underneath the powered table) via Ethernet plus a fiber cable. The camera-to-OCT-engine Ethernet connection should be considered internal, similar to the internal NIC on a Cirrus HD-OCT or HFA3. However, this internal connection is configured by default to be on the NIC labeled with the number 1 with a connector icon. In the reference image below, it is the port on the right side with the green circle. Ensure the cable is snug and the connector clicks when inserted into the correct port(s).</p>

<p>The Cirrus Photo's PC module includes another Ethernet port (toward the center, with the red X in the image above, though exact inputs layout may vary for some models) which is suitable for external network connection. Do not attempt to use the external port to connect to the OCT module or vice-versa.</p>
<p>If the customer has checked the connections on both ends, ensured the correct ports are being used for the internal and external connections, and verified the Ethernet cable being used works, collect any relevant logs (located in <code>C:\Program Files\CZM\Cirrus Photo\Logs</code>) and dispatch a Field Service Engineer (FSE).</p>
