<p>To start, have the customer try "Mydriatic" or "Myd" option (see item #17 in the reference image) to see if this improves the function of the infrared preview pane. If this improves the visibility, the root cause is almost certainly a faulty infrared (IR) laser. If there is no change based on the Mydriatic setting, the lightbox may be failing or have already failed.</p>
<p>In either case, an onsite FSE dispatch is required to resolve the issue with the IR laser or lightbox, but the customer may be able to use the instrument in a reduced capacity with the Myd setting.</p>
