<p>This error indicates that the system was unable to complete initialization. This is often due to a failure to attain the required projector intensity.</p>
<p>First remediation step is to replace the projection lamp bulb. If customer does not have a spare bulb, create a Spare Parts Order ticket for part number 266002-1148-110, description: PCBA SANTA CRUZ PROJECTION LAMP. Video instructions for replacing the bulb can be found <a href="https://sde.zeiss.com/web/share/diid:4d65eb08-f5c9-489d-970c-3b8ec2bac72c/6a2476263903c63c5b50054c9331c7e893b7ec9e787ad163e400b2cbabf2babf/shareid:fb0a9423-1582-415b-95f0-bd1aa9caa168/0/0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
